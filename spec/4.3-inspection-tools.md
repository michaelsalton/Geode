# 4.3 Inspection Tools

**Phase**: 3 - Visualization
**Week**: 9
**File**: `src/viewer/inspection.cpp`

## Purpose
Interactive tools for detailed cluster inspection and debugging.

## Features

### Cluster Selection
- Click on point to select cluster
- Highlight selected cluster (outline or brightening)
- Ray-cast from mouse position to find cluster

### Cluster Info Panel

```
Cluster ID: 42
Primitives: 3,241
Bounding Box: [min, max]

--- PCA Metrics ---
Planarity: 0.85
Linearity: 0.12
Sphericity: 0.03

--- Alpha Metrics ---
Mean: 0.92
Variance: 0.04
Range: [0.85, 0.98]

--- Other ---
Normal Coherence: 0.88

Classification: MESH_OPTIMAL
Confidence: 0.91
```

### Cluster Isolation
- "Isolate" button: hide all other clusters
- "Show All" button: restore full scene
- Useful for inspecting problematic classifications

### Export Tools
- Export current view as PNG
- Export classification results as JSON
- Export labeled scene as colored PLY

### Threshold Adjustment
- Sliders for each threshold
- Live re-classification as thresholds change
- "Reset" button for default thresholds
- Save custom thresholds to config file

## Implementation
- Use ImGui for UI panels
- Use Polyscope selection API
- Cache original colors for restoration

## Validation
- Can click any cluster and see metrics
- Threshold changes update visualization immediately
- Exports produce valid files
